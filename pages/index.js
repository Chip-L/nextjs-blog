          Hello! My name is Chip Long. I have been working as a manual software
          quality assurance engineer for the past 12 years. I started that
          career working at a third party testing house so I was able to test a
          very wide variety of software. Everything from games, to websites, to
          security programs. I have also worked briefly in the insurance world,
          but mostly the last several years have been working in FinTech on
          mobile banking solutions.
