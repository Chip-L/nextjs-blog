**NextJS tutorial** was a very nice introduction to the NextJS framework. It did a good job of explaining how things worked, starting with React. It introduced the concepts very well. Since NextJS does static rendering, server side rendering, and client side rendering it gave fairly good detail on the differences. I would have liked it to go a bit deeper, but it did include a number of further references for it.

I was impressed with NextJS overall. It was **VERY** easy to use. For the most part, it felt just like React (since it really is mostly React!) but it wasn't as complicated. The built in routing, made me feel like I was just coding a regular HTML page, just with React components.

This was definitely worth an evening to look at this. I have a couple of projects that I might try this on... You all will just have to wait and see!
